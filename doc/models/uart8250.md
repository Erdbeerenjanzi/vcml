# VCML Models: UART8250
----

This is a TLM model of the standard 8250/16550A UARTs used for serial I/O. It
models the functional aspects of the real device, so it looks like a real UART
for the software. However, most of the physical aspects have been omitted
(e.g., data is transmitted instantly, transmission errors cannot occur, etc.).

The model uses the backend subsystem for outputting data. A common choice would
be the `term` backend, which allows input and output via `stdout` and `stdin`
from a terminal window. Input is polled once per quantum and is only fetched
from the backend if the FIFOs are not full, so data is never dropped.

The model can be operated in interrupt or polling mode.

## Properties
This model has the following properties:

| Property        | Type        | Default   | Description        |
| --------------- | ---------   | ----------| ------------------ |
| `clock`         | `clock_t`   | `3686400` | UART clock (in Hz) |
| `read_latency`  | `sc_time`   | `0ns`     | Extra read delay   |
| `write_latency` | `sc_time`   | `0ns`     | Extra write delay  |
| `backends`      | `string`    | `<empty>` | List of backends   |
| `allow_dmi`     | `bool`      | `true`    | Ignored            |
| `loglvl`        | `log_level` | `info`    | Logging threshold  |
| `trace_errors`  | `bool`      | `false`   | Report TLM errors  |

Extra properties are available from the specified [`backends`](../backends.md).

## Hardware Interface

The following ports and sockets must be connected prior to simulating:

| Port  | Type                  | Description                   |
| ----- | --------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `IN`  | `tlm_target_socket<>` | Input socket for bus requests |
| `IRQ` | `sc_out<bool>`        | Interrupt port                |

## Software Interface

The model exposes the following memory mapped registers:

| Name  | Offset | Access | Description                                     |
| ----- | ------ | ------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `THR` | `+0x0` |  R/W   | Rx Buffer (R) / Tx Buffer (W) Register          |
| `IER` | `+0x1` |  R/W   | Interrupt Enable Register                       |
| `IIR` | `+0x2` |  R/W   | Interrupt Identification (R) / FIFO Control (W) |
| `LCR` | `+0x3` |  R/W   | Line Control Register                           |
| `MCR` | `+0x4` |  R/W   | Modem Control Register                          |
| `LSR` | `+0x5` |  R     | Line Status Register                            |
| `MSR` | `+0x6` |  R     | Modem Status Register                           |
| `SCR` | `+0x7` |  R/W   | Scratchpad Register                             |

This device model works with Linux:

* As early boot console: add `earlycon=uart,mmio,<addr>` to kernel parameters
* As a serial device via the device tree: use `compatible = "16550a";`

The corresponding drivers can be found in `drivers/tty/serial/8250`.
